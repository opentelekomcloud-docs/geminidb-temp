Querying Traces
===============

After CTS is enabled, CTS starts recording operations on cloud resources. The CTS console stores the last seven days of operation records.

This section describes how to query operation records for the last 7 days on the CTS console.

Procedure

#. Log in to the management console.
#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select a region and a project.
#. Click **Service List**. Under **Management & Deployment**, click **Cloud Trace Service**.
#. Choose **Trace List** in the navigation pane on the left.
#. Specify the filters used for querying traces. The following four filters are available:
