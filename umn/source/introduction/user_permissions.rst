User Permissions
================

GaussDB NoSQL provides two types of user permissions by default: user management and resource management.

-  User management refers to the management of users, user groups, and user group permissions.
-  Resource management refers to the control operations that can be performed by users on cloud service resources.

For details about GaussDB NoSQL user permissions, see `Permissions <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/permissions/index.html>`__.
