System Architecture
===================

GeminiDB is a distributed database with decoupled compute and storage architecture. The compute clusters consist of multiple homogeneous nodes, and data is stored in a distributed, shared storage pool. Compute and storage resources are decoupled from each other so they can be flexibly scaled in or out without having to migrate any data.
